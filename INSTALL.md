# Zola Installation Guide (No Auth)

Zola is a free, open-source AI chat app using OpenAI models only. This guide covers how to install and run Zola on different platforms, including Docker deployment options.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn
- Git
- OpenAI API key

## Environment Setup

First, you'll need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project with the variables from `.env.example`

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# CSRF Protection
CSRF_SECRET=your_csrf_secret_key

# Only OpenAI is supported in this build

# Optional: Set the URL for production
# NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=your_production_url
```

A `.env.example` file is included in the repository for reference. Copy this file to `.env.local` and update the values with your credentials.

### Generating a CSRF Secret

The `CSRF_SECRET` is used to protect your application against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. You need to generate a secure random string for this value. Here are a few ways to generate one:

#### Using Node.js

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

#### Using OpenSSL

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

#### Using Python

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Copy the generated value and add it to your `.env.local` file as the `CSRF_SECRET` value.

### Authentication

Authentication has been removed. The app generates a local guest id for lightweight rate-limit checks.

### Database Schema

No database is required in this fork.

### Recommended OpenAI Models

 - `gpt-5` — highest quality, best reasoning
 - `gpt-5-mini` — balanced quality/speed
 - `gpt-5-nano` — fastest and cheapest

## Local Installation

### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ibelick/zola.git
cd zola

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

### Windows

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ibelick/zola.git
cd zola

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Docker Installation

### Option 1: Single Container with Docker

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project if that doesnt exist:

```dockerfile
# Base Node.js image
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install dependencies with clean slate
RUN npm ci

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy node_modules from deps
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules

# Copy all project files
COPY . .

# Set Next.js telemetry to disabled
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

# Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Set the correct permission for prerender cache
RUN mkdir -p .next/cache && chown -R nextjs:nodejs .next/cache

# Copy necessary files for production
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

# Switch to non-root user
USER nextjs

# Expose application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Set environment variable for port
ENV PORT 3000
ENV HOSTNAME 0.0.0.0

# Health check to verify container is running properly
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=5s --retries=3 CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:3000/ || exit 1

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t zola .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key \
  zola
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  zola:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run with Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the services
docker-compose down
```

<!-- Ollama and other providers removed in this build -->

## Production Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy Zola is using Vercel:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Import the project into Vercel
3. Configure your environment variables
4. Deploy

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Self-Hosted Production

For a self-hosted production environment, you'll need to build the application and run it:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

## Configuration Options

You can customize various aspects of Zola by modifying the configuration files:

- `app/lib/config.ts`: Configure AI models, daily message limits, etc.
- `.env.local`: Set environment variables and API keys

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI models not responding**

   - Verify your OpenAI API key is set and valid
   - Check that the selected model is available

2. **Docker container exits immediately**
   - Check logs using `docker logs <container_id>`
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set
